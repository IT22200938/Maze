## Tips for Success

1. **Start Early:** Don't wait until the last minute
2. **Test Frequently:** Test each component before moving on
3. **Document As You Go:** Take notes and screenshots during development
4. **Backup Everything:** Use GitHub regularly
5. **Communicate:** Work together with your group
6. **Ask Questions:** Use ROS forums, Stack Overflow, and course resources
7. **Time Management:** SLAM mapping and DQL training take time!

## Time Estimates

- Setup & Installation: 2-3 hours
- Maze Creation: 2-3 hours
- SLAM Mapping: 2-4 hours
- Nav2 Navigation: 3-5 hours
- DQL Implementation: 10-20 hours (training)
- Testing & Data Collection: 4-6 hours
- Report Writing: 8-12 hours
- **Total: 30-50 hours**

Plan accordingly!
