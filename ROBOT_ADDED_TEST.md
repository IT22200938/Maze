# ‚úÖ Robot Added to Maze World!

## What I Just Did

I added a complete TurtleBot3 Burger robot model directly into your `worlds/maze_world.sdf` file.

**The robot now includes:**
- ‚úÖ Blue box body (0.14m x 0.14m)
- ‚úÖ Two drive wheels (left and right)
- ‚úÖ Caster wheel (for balance)
- ‚úÖ LiDAR sensor (360-degree scan, 3.5m range)
- ‚úÖ Differential drive plugin (responds to /cmd_vel)
- ‚úÖ Odometry publishing (/odom topic)
- ‚úÖ Spawns at position: (-1.25, 1.25, 0.01) - top-left corner

---

## Test Now - See the Robot!

### Step 1: Close Current Gazebo

If Gazebo is still running, close it (Ctrl+C in the terminal or close the window).

### Step 2: Relaunch with Robot Included

```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
source install/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

# Launch again
ros2 launch turtlebot3_maze_navigation gazebo_maze_v2.launch.py
```

### Step 3: What You Should See

**In Gazebo:**
- ‚úÖ The maze (same as before)
- ‚úÖ **A blue box robot** in the top-left corner
- ‚úÖ Two black wheels on the sides
- ‚úÖ Green LiDAR visualization (if you enable sensor view)

**In Entity Tree (right panel):**
- `turtlebot3_burger` should now appear!
  - `base_link`
  - `left_wheel`
  - `right_wheel`
  - `caster`
  - `lidar` (sensor)

## Test Robot Control

Once the robot appears, test if it responds to commands:

### Terminal 2: Check Topics

```bash
source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash
ros2 topic list
```

**You should see:**
- `/cmd_vel` - Robot control
- `/scan` - LiDAR data
- `/odom` - Odometry
- `/clock` - Simulation time

### Terminal 2: Test Movement

```bash
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
```

**Controls:**
- `w` - Forward
- `x` - Backward
- `a` - Turn left
- `d` - Turn right
- `s` - Stop
- `SPACE` - Emergency stop

**Try:** Press `w` and watch the robot move forward in Gazebo!

## Verify LiDAR is Working

### Check Scan Data:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /scan --once
```

**Expected output:**
- `ranges: [...]` - Array of 360 distance measurements
- Values should be between 0.12m and 3.5m
- Close to walls = small numbers
- Open space = larger numbers

## What's Different Now

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| ‚ùå No robot in world file | ‚úÖ Robot embedded in world file |
| ‚ùå Robot spawning via launch file | ‚úÖ Gazebo loads robot automatically |
| ‚ùå Spawning could fail | ‚úÖ Robot always appears |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è Complex dependencies | ‚úÖ Self-contained |

## If You See the Robot - Next Steps!

### 1. Test Manual Control (5 mins)

Drive around with teleop keyboard to:
- Verify robot moves
- Test collision with walls
- Ensure LiDAR detects obstacles

### 2. Start SLAM Mapping (15 mins)

Now that the robot works, create a map!

**Terminal 1 - Keep Gazebo running**

**Terminal 2 - Start SLAM:**
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_maze_navigation cartographer.launch.py
```

**Terminal 3 - Drive around:**
```bash
ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
```

**Drive slowly through the entire maze for 10 minutes.**

**Terminal 4 - Save map:**
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_maze_navigation/maps
ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f maze_map
```

### 3. Test Autonomous Navigation (10 mins)

**Close everything, then:**

**Terminal 1 - Gazebo:**
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
source install/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger
ros2 launch turtlebot3_maze_navigation gazebo_maze_v2.launch.py
```

**Terminal 2 - Navigation:**
```bash
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws
source install/setup.bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_maze_navigation navigation.launch.py
```

**In RViz:**
1. Set initial pose (2D Pose Estimate)
2. Click goal location (2D Goal Pose)
3. Watch robot navigate autonomously!

## Troubleshooting

### Robot not visible?

**Check Entity Tree in Gazebo:**
- Look for `turtlebot3_burger` in the list
- If not there, world file might not have updated

**Force refresh:**
```bash
# In your Maze directory
cd ~/turtlebot3_ws/src/turtlebot3_maze_navigation
ls -la worlds/maze_world.sdf  # Check file was updated
```

### Robot falls through floor?

The pose is set to z=0.01. If it falls:
- Change `<pose>-1.25 1.25 0.01 0 0 0</pose>` to `<pose>-1.25 1.25 0.05 0 0 0</pose>`

### No /scan topic?

Check if sensor plugin loaded:
```bash
gz topic -l | grep scan
```

If Gazebo topics show scan but ROS doesn't, check the bridge is running:
```bash
ros2 node list | grep bridge
```
