5. **Git Often:** Push to GitHub regularly
6. **Backup Data:** Save all performance results
7. **Practice Demo:** Run through VIVA demo multiple times

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

Already documented in README.md, but quick reference:

- **Gazebo won't start:** `killall gz` then relaunch
- **Package not found:** Rebuild and source workspace
- **Robot falls:** Check Z position in launch file
- **Map is noisy:** Drive slower, adjust Cartographer params
- **Navigation fails:** Check initial pose, clear costmaps

## üìà Time Estimates

Based on typical student experience:

- **Setup & Build:** 2-3 hours
- **Testing & Debugging:** 3-5 hours  
- **SLAM Mapping:** 2-4 hours
- **Nav2 Testing:** 3-5 hours
- **DQL Training (optional):** 10-20 hours
- **Data Collection:** 4-6 hours
- **Report Writing:** 8-12 hours
- **Demo Prep:** 2-3 hours

**Total: 34-58 hours** (without DQL: 24-38 hours)

Plan your time accordingly!

## ü§ù Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the README.md troubleshooting section
2. Review ROS 2 Jazzy documentation
3. Check Nav2 documentation
4. Use `ros2 topic list` and `ros2 node list` to debug
5. Check terminal output for error messages
